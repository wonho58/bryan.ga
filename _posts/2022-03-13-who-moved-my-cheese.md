Life repetitiously confronts changes throughout decades. 
All the creatures go through adjustments and revolutionary development as time passes by. 
However, even if we stand against the changes often, it isn’t always the easy thing to adapt to. 
New conditions might be fearsome and can feel repulsed. 

#### The book that I read is about the changes we face throughout time and how to overcome it.

To summarize the story, it begins from the meeting of people who had been classmates when they were young. 
They opened up one’s feelings about their life. 
It was predominantly about the change of life such as business, family, and education. 
As a solution, Michael started a story called “Who Moved My Cheese”, to support his own friends to adapt to the new atmosphere they are struggling with. 
It is a story about Scurry and Sniff who are the two mice and Haw and Hem who are the two small people. 
The only difference between them was that mice were simple and people were sophisticated. 
They wandered around the maze to find the cheese station and it was a total nightmare for them. 
As soon as they continued to live within the cheese station, cheese was lacking out and there wasn’t any more cheese provided. 
Two mice expected it to happen since they were noticing that the amount of cheese provided were decreasing day by day, so as they prepared, they spontaneously started wandering the maze again. 
However, Hem and Haw overreacted and overthink about the situation with unnecessary worries. 
As the time passed by, Haw laughed at himself for not being courageous and left Hem who resisted and went into the maze. 
At first he was terrified about the unknown future but as he laughed over it, he succeeded to find the cheese station full of a bunch of cheese.
 
The lesson that was included in the book was if we let something go, we gain something back. 
Nothing can be left without any returns. Changes might be horrific and unintimate, but if we get used to it, we might find a labyrinth towards a bright future. 
Main 7 steps suggested by Ham are “Change happens, anticipate change, monitor change, adapt to change quickly, chage, enjoy change, be ready to change quickly and enjoy it again and again.”. 
This suggests that changes aren’t always in a bad way. 
It shows a path to a better place and improves us. 
Also, my personal favorite quote from him was “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”. 
It questioned me a lot whilst I was having trouble with horror. 
I wasn’t that courageous about the particular situation I faced and surroundings asked me what I would do if this situation wasn’t fearful at all. 
It provided me with a bunch of solutions and it encouraged me to move forward. 
I think this book is a great morality towards society and people whoever is contending with similar condition.
