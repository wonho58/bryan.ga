The Talk

Appealing mid-night breeze, I stood there waiting for nothing. 
The Pitch-dark river glittered with illusions of night view. 
I sat down on the bridge, serene scent permeating around me; on a sparsely populated road. 
Suddenly, someone sat beside me, looking at the night view as well as I was. 
He abruptly looked into my empty eyes, smiling like a golden retriever seeing his long-lost friend.

“Tonight is the most beautiful night, I believe.”, he said.

I ignored his words, waiting for him to let me be whilst I act ignorant, but he didn’t. He kept on crawling towards me, sitting right beside me, watching and waiting for my response while viewing the night sky filled with nothing; like an empty, black canvas.

“World is not wonderful as it is. Rose is believed to be beautiful but has sharp thorns surrounding itself protecting its own.”, he opened his mouth again. 
“However when you reach towards the truth, you will learn what’s the most important and valuable thing is in this vast universe, the only thing that you can know.”

I constantly tried to act bothered and immensely uncomfortable while being around him. 
I didn’t have enough time to listen to his meaningless lectures and learnings that will be nothing after my last mission gets completed. 
I turned my back from him, forming an invisible wall between us, but it was kept on broken off by him.

“What is life?”, he asked, and I verged to answer to end this annoyance.
“Who are you, a drunken philosophy professor who teaches a person who already gave up on living?”, he laughed deliriously, swiping his eyes.
“Thank you for such a compliment, so your opinion on my question is?”, “Life is nothing.”, I responded.
“Yes, you are correct. Life is nothing. But I want to demonstrate more on it. Life is also everything.”, he said, with a grin.

I thought about it. Life is nothing but also everything. We don’t have any purpose in living, it was just destined for us when we were born, brought to life. However, even if so life was everything in us. 
Accomplishing the task right before the due date, being on the list, eating, gaming, seeing, breathing, it was all going along by life.

“Life, can be vulnerable easily but isn’t. Death is very approachable but is not. There is always no answer in this world.”, he added. “Life is meaningful but meaningless, and we are valued but also unknown. Isn’t it interesting?”.
“So what’s the point of making conversation with a half-dead person? Wouldn’t you make a lecture in front of society to spread this message rather than a single person here without any positive perspective towards life?”, I asked.

“That is why I am talking to you.”, he answered.

He dragged me out of the edge of the bridge, cuffing me around his jacket, bringing me to some elsewhere saying,
“Do you want to have a cup of tea?”.

And I answered,
“Yes, please.”.
